		While studying for my B.S. of Computer Science, I worked on a lot of different projects. It wasn't until I started tailoring my resume and writing cover letters for each position I was applying to that I realized I might have been selling myself short for these positions. 
		<br> 
		A review of my courses that had coding projects showed me how much I had actually learned in process of gaining my degree. I've split the courses in "Main" and "Electives"; my school only required 3 higher-level electives and I was unfortunately unable to take more even though I wanted to.
